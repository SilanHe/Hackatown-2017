stm tracker

crowd based stm data and trends

#inspiration
Everyone around me has trouble with the public transit system, in particular the bus system. We feel like people would appreciate a crowd based site that the community contributes to in order to improve the public transit system by ourselves.

#what it does
At the press of a button, you can use natural language to post and search the database for data and trends. 

#How we built it
React and bootstrap for the slick frontend.
Mongodb and Nuance Mix.nlu backend.

#Challenges we ran into
Frontend: Being able to interface with the frontend effectively to provide a sleek user experience. Testing multiple frameworks to find the one we need for our project. Exceded number of transactions for the nuance api due to interactive search which stalled the hack for a while.

#What's next for i missed a bus
network security, published website, better data visualization in terms of graphs, maybe expand in terms of how safe the bus ride is, how busy the bus is, if you can get a seat or not,

#Built With
